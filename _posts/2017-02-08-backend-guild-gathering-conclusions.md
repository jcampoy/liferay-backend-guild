On Wednesday January 25th morning the Global Backend Guild joined to talk about the idea of the global Guild, try to define our main goals, things we're interested in and, last but not least, the kind of activities that we'd like to promote in order to achieve the previous goals. This post tries to make a quick summary of the topics we discussed during our meeting.

The first thing we discussed was the guild's goals, and we ended up with this:

* Promote Liferay's culture
* Promote quality
* Help to member's professional growth
* Spread the knowledge
* Safe place: make sure all the people is aware this is a safe place

Once we decided our goals (of course, this is not a closed list) we started a discussion about the kind of activities that could help us to achieve our goals

* Workshops, talks, hack days, videos on specific topics, ... . Record and make them available in a Loop/Slack channel
* Create a Loop/Slack channel so we can share different articles, videos, newsletters, ... whatever we consider interesting for the guild.
* Bringing experts to talk about different topics
* Developer gathering once per year
* Share your experience from other source projects with the rest of the team
* Promote the rotation among the different company's projects
* Promote the "mobility". Work close to these colleagues that are usually far away from your daily office
* Create a global engineering blog
* Spread the knowledge out of the company

Finally, we tried to gather the interests of all our guild's members. This is a just a brief summary:

* "New" technologies?
* Some people has asked about Akka, SpringBoot, OSGi Enroute, ...
* "New" programming languages and paradigms?
* Some people has asked me about Go and Java 8
* Functional programming
* How to bridge languages into existing products
* JVM Topics: data structures, concurrency, ...
* "New" software architectures?
* Machine learning
* Cloud computing
* Some people has asked about IaaS, containers, PaaS
* Data processing at scale
* Databases
* NoSQL: graphs
* Systems architecture
* Unikernels
* IoT
* OSGi Specs
    * Distributed OSGi
* Maths/ Computer Science
* Performance
* Security

I am really happy about how the session worked. As you can see, we have a huge task ahead and it's gonna be tough, but we'll work hard to achieve our goals.
