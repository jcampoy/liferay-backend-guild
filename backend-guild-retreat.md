## A review of the year and planning the future (2 hours)

The concept of the guild has not been really enforced during this year, and we’re trying to fix it, but we’d like to discuss what we’ve done in this year, and what kind of things we want to achieve in the future

##  Machine Learning: An introduction (2 hours)

Machine learning is anything new, but it’s gaining a lot of traction nowadays due the advent of the Big Data world. We will try to do a simple introduction where we can learn the very basic fundamentals and what kind of things can be achieved.

## Containers: An introduction (2 hours)

Containers are an extremely hot topic, and if you look around, they’re everywhere. In this workshop, using Docker as the overarching element, we’ll learn how this “new” technology works, what kind of scenarios this tech is useful for, or how we can deploy our applications using it.

## Cloud deployments: A gentle introduction to AWS (2h) (2 hours)

Do you know how to deploy your apps a Cloud provider? Do you know how to scale them? Or how to configure a Load Balancer? Have you ever run a multi-zone database? These and many other questions will be solved in this workshop, and we will learn some of the fundamentals to be considered when we’re building Cloud Native Applications

## Java 8: a whole new world (2 hours)

With the release of Liferay 7 we’ve finally moved to Java 8 (yay!). The goal of this workshop is to learn how we can leverage the new features provided by Java 8 which help us to write better code. But not only that, we also pretend to introduce you to the functional programming world, an old programming paradigm which is gaining traction nowadays (yes, we’ll talk about monads)

## New programming languages: Go (2 hours)

Not everything is Java out there. There’re hundreds of different programming languages available In this workshop we’ll learn the fundamentals of the Go programming language, how we’re already using it and why it is “popular” amongst many open source projects

## Security Tooling (2h)

Security is not a really well known topic for many engineers. During the workshop we will learn how to use the tools we’ve built, what they help us to solve, and how they’ve been built. Hopefully this session will help us to get started into the security world.
