## Performance: A brief introduction

This is an unknown topic for many engineers. The goal of this workshop will be to introduce them into the performance world: how you can measure things, available tools, common mistakes. Once the workshop is done, you won’t be an expert, but, hopefully, we’ll provide you a good starting point in case you wanna/need to go deeper

## Java 8: An intro to the functional programming world

With the release of Liferay 7 we’ve finally moved to Java 8 (yay!). The goal of this workshop is to learn how we can leverage the new features provided by Java 8 which help us to write better code. But not only that, we also pretend to introduce you to the functional programming world, an old programming paradigm which is gaining traction nowadays (yes, we’ll talk about monads)

## Security Tooling (2h)

Security is not a really know topic for many engineers. During the workshop we will learn how to use the tools we’ve built, what they help us to solve, and how they’ve been built. Hopefully this session will help us to get started into the security world.
