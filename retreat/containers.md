### Why containers are so sexy?
Containers are rocking the IT scene, but why? We'll see a brief introduction to the benefits of using containers.

### Differences with virtual machines
But why not using virtual machines? Let's see the diferences between hardware virtualization and operative system virtualization.

### Anatomy of a Container
A container representes a reduced operative system, but how is it possible? We'll see how Linux capabilities allows isolating process hierarchies, network stacks, resources access and so on.

### Docker Networking
How Docker containers communicate with each others? Let's see how the network is set between Docker containers.

### Persistence
Stateful applications in volatile environments sounds a complex thing. Let's understand how Docker manages persistent data using volumes.

### Communicating containers and applications
Once our application is isolated, we need to communicate with the outside world, let's say processes' ports and data.
